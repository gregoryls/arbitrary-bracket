- edwards paper for bracket methodology
- formula for match spacing by round in winners bracket
  - round 1 always entrants / 2
  - (entrants/4 + 0.5) + (2 \* round)
    - divide by four, two from the match pairings, two again to find the middle
    - round zero indexed here
- losers match spacing formulae
  - round 1 always entrants / 4
  - odd rounds self-play (consider round 1 self-play since all fresh), even new entrants

- edwards paper for bracket methodology
- formula for match spacing by round in winners bracket
  - round 1 always entrants / 2
  - (2^(round-2) + 0.5) + (2^(round-1)) \* (match - 1)
- losers match spacing formulae
  - round 1 always entrants / 4
  - odd rounds self-play (consider round 1 self-play since all fresh), even new entrants
  - 2^r-3,-4..., 2^r-2,-3...(m-1)
